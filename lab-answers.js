//* Easy Going 
//Write a for loop that will log the numbers 1 through 20

//* Get Even
//Write a for loop that will log only the even numbers in 0 through 200.

    console.log(x);
}

//* Fizz Buzz
//Write a Javascript Application that logs all numbers from 1 - 100.
//If a number is divisible by 3, log "Fizz" instead of the number.
//If a number is divisible by 5, log "Buzz" instead of the number.
//If a number is divisible by 3 and 5, log "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
